# Store Management System

This Python program demonstrates a simple store management system with classes for `Product` and `Category`. It allows you to create products, categorize them, and retrieve information about categories and products.

## Instructions

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Download the `product.py` and `category.py` files from the `src` directory.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## Functionality

- The `Product` class represents a product with attributes such as name, description, price, and quantity.
- The `Category` class represents a category with a name, description, and a list of products.
- You can add a new product to a category using the `add_product` method.
- The `new_product` method in the `Product` class allows creating a new product from a dictionary.
- The price of a product can be updated, and negative or zero prices are handled appropriately.

Feel free to explore the code and make modifications as needed for your specific store management requirements.
